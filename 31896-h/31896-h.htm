<p>This collection of poems is entirely new with the exception of three or
four which appeared in two earlier volumes, published some ten years
ago. The reprinted poems have been carefully re-written, and so changed
throughout as to hardly bear any resemblance, except that of subject, to
the original.</p>

<span class="i0">Not far from here, it lies beyond<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That low-hilled belt of woods. We'll take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This unused lane where brambles make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wall of twilight, and the blond<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brier-roses pelt the path and flake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The margin waters of a pond.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This is its fence&mdash;or that which was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its fence once&mdash;now, rock rolled from rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One tangle of the vine and dock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where bloom the wild petunias;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this its gate, the iron-weeds block,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hot with the insects' dusty buzz.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Two wooden posts, wherefrom has peeled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weather-crumbled paint, still rise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gaunt things&mdash;that groan when someone tries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gate whose hinges, rust-congealed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snarl open:&mdash;on each post still lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its carven lion with a shield.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We enter; and between great rows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of locusts winds a grass-grown road;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at its glimmering end,&mdash;o'erflowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With quiet light,&mdash;the white front shows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of an old mansion, grand and broad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With grave Colonial porticoes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Grown thick around it, dark and deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The locust trees make one vast hush;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their brawny branches crowd and crush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its very casements, and o'ersweep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its rotting roofs; their tranquil rush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haunts all its spacious rooms with sleep.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still is it called The Locusts; though<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None lives here now. A tale's to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some dark thing that here befell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A crime that happened years ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When by its walls, with shot and shell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The war swept on and left it so.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For one black night, within it, shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made revel, while, all here about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With prayer or curse or battle-shout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men died and homesteads leapt in flame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then passed the conquering Northern rout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left it silent and the same.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Why should I speak of what has been?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or what dark part I played in all?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why ruin sits in porch and hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where pride and gladness once were seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And why beneath this lichened wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grave of Margaret is green.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Heart-broken Margaret! whose fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was sadder yet than his who won<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hand&mdash;my brother Hamilton&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or mine, who learned to know too late;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who learned to know, when all was done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nothing could exonerate.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To expiate is still my lot,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like the Ancient Mariner,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To show to others how things are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what I am, still helps me blot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little from that crime's red scar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That on my soul is branded hot.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He was my only brother. She<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sister of my brother's friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They met, and married in the end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I remember well when he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought her rejoicing home, the trend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of war moved towards us sullenly.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And scarce a year of wedlock when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its red arms took him from his bride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lips by hers thrice sanctified<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He left to ride with Morgan's men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I&mdash;I never could decide&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remained at home. It happened then.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For days went by. And, oft delayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A letter came of loving word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scrawled by some camp-fire, sabre-stirred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or by a pine-knot's fitful aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When in the saddle, armed and spurred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And booted for some hurried raid.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then weeks went by. I do not know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How long it was before there came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blown from the North, the clarion fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Morgan, who, with blow on blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had drawn a line of blood and flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Tennessee to Ohio.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then letters ceased; and days went on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No word from him. The war rolled back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in its turgid crimson track<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rumor grew, like some wild dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All ominous and red and black,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With news of our lost Hamilton,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That hinted death or capture. Yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No thing was sure; till one day,&mdash;fed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By us,&mdash;some men rode up who said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They'd been with Morgan and had met<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disaster, and that he was dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My brother.&mdash;I and Margaret<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Believed them. Grief was ours too:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But mine was more for her than him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grief, that her eyes with tears were dim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grief, that became the avenue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For love, who crowned the sombre brim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of death's dark cup with rose-red hue.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In sympathy,&mdash;unconsciously<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though it be given&mdash;I hold, doth dwell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The germ of love that time shall swell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To blossom. Sooner then in me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When close relations so befell&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That love should spring from sympathy.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Our similar tastes and mutual bents<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From our first meeting. Different states<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of interest then our temperaments<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begot. Then friendship, that abates<br /></span>

<span class="i0">These led to talks and dreams: how oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We sat at some wide window while<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun sank o'er the hills' far file,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Serene; and of the cloud aloft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made one vast rose; and mile on mile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of firmament grew sad and soft.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And all in harmony with these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dim clemencies of dusk, afar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our talks and dreams went; while the star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of evening brightened o'er the trees:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We spoke of home; the end of war:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We dreamed of life and love and peace.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How on our walks in listening lanes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or confidences of the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We paused to hear the dove that cooed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or gathered wild-flowers, taking pains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find the fairest; or her hood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filled with wild fruit that left deep stains.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No echo of the drum or fife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No hint of conflict entered in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our thoughts then. Will you call it sin&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indifference to a nation's strife?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What side might lose, what side might win,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both immaterial to our life.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Into the past we did not look;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond what was we did not dream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While onward rushed the thunderous stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of war, that, in its torrent, took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One of our own. No crimson gleam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of its wild course around us shook.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last we knew. And when we learned<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Within my soul I half discerned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A joy that mingled with regret,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A grief that to relief was turned.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As time went on and confidence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew us more strongly each to each,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why did no intimation reach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its warning hand into the dense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soul-silence, and confuse the speech<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of love's unbroken eloquence!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But, no! no hint to turn the poise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or check the impulse of our youth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To chill it with the living truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As with the awe of God's own voice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No hint, to make our hope uncouth;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To me a wall seemed overthrown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That social law had raised between;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er its ruin, broad and green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A path went, I possessed alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sky above seemed all serene;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The land around seemed all my own.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What shall I say of Margaret<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To justify her part in this?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That her young heart was never his?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But had been mine since first we met?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So would you say!&mdash;Enough it is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That when he left she loved him yet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So passed the Spring, and Summer sped;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And early Autumn brought the day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she her hand in mine should lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I should take her hand and wed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still no hint that might gainsay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No warning word of quick or dead.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Only his mind to don the buff and green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And live a forester with us and be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enfellowed in the Duke of Brunswick's train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for the Duke's estate even now was bound.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Tall was he for his age and strong and brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lithe of limb; and with a face that seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hope's counterpart&mdash;but with the eyes of doubt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep restless disks, instinct with gleaming night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That seemed to say, "We're sure of earth, at least<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For some short space, my friend; but afterward&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay! ransack not to-morrow till to-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest it engulf thy joy before it is!"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he spoke, the fire in his eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worked stealthy as a hunted animal's;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or like the Count von Hackelnburg's that turn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feeling the unseen presence of a fiend.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Then, as it chanced, old Kurt had come that morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With some six of his jerkined foresters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the Thuringian forest; wet with dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fresh as morn with early travel; bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Brunswick, Dummburg and the Hakel passed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chief huntsman he then to our lord the Duke,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And father of the loveliest maiden here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Ammendorf, the sunny Ilsabe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her mother dead, the gray-haired father prized<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His daughter more than all that men hold dear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His only happiness, who was beloved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all as Lora of Thuringia was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For gentle ways that spoke a noble soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winning all hearts to love her and to praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As might a great and beautiful thought that holds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Us by the simplest words.&mdash;Her eyes were blue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the high influence of a summer day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hair,&mdash;serene and braided over brows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White as a Harz dove's wing,&mdash;was auburn brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deep as mists the sun has drenched with gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her young presence&mdash;well, 't was like a song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A far Tyrolean melody of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard on an Alpine path at close of day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When shepherds homeward lead their tinkling flocks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when she left, being with you awhile,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How shall I say it?&mdash;'t was as when one hath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld an Undine by the moonlit Rhine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, ere the mind adjusts a thought, is gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in your soul you wonder if a dream.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Some thirty years ago it was;&mdash;and I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Commissioner of the Duke&mdash;(no sinecure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can assure you)&mdash;had scarce reached the age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thirty,&mdash;that we sat here at our wine;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And 't was through me that Rudolf,&mdash;whom at first,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From some rash words dropped then in argument,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The foresterhood was like to be denied,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was then enfellowed. "Yes," said I, "he's young.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kurt, he is young; but see, a wiry frame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A chamois footing and a face for deeds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An eye that likes me not; too quick to turn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that may be the restless soul within;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A soul perhaps with virtues that have been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Severely tried and could not stand the test;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These be thy care, Kurt; and if not too deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vices of the flesh, discover them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As divers bring lost riches up from ooze.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast a daughter; let him be thy son."<br /></span>
<span class="i3">A year thereafter was it that I heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Rudolf's passion for Kurt's Ilsabe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then their betrothal. And it was from this,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good Mother Mary! how she haunts me still!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet Ilsabe! whose higher womanhood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True as the touchstone which philosophers feign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transmutes to gold base metals it may touch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had turned to good all evil in this man,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surmised I of the excellency which<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refinement of her purer company,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And contact with her innocence, had resolved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fiery nature to, conditioning slave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so I came from Brunswick&mdash;as, you know,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Is custom of the Duke or, by his seal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Commissioned proxy, his commissioner&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To test the marksmanship of Rudolf, who<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Succeeded Kurt with marriage of his child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An heir of Kuno.&mdash;He?&mdash;Greatgrandfather<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Kurt; and of this forestkeepership<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first possessor; thus established here&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or this the tale they tell on winter nights:<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Kuno, once in the Knight of Wippach's train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rode on a grand hunt with the Duke, who came,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grandfather of the father of our Duke,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With much magnificence of knights and squires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great velvet-vestured nobles, cloaked and plumed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hunt Thuringian deer. Then morn,&mdash;too quick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bid good-morrow,&mdash;was too slow for these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the wind-trod hills recumbent yawned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disturbed an hour too soon; all sleepy-eyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like some young milkmaid whom the cock hath roused,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sits and rubs stiff eyes that still will close.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Horns sang and deer-hounds tugged a whimpering leash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, loosened, bounded through the baying glens:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ere the mountain mists, compact of white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke wild before the azure spears of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The far-off hunt, that woke the woods to life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed but the heart-beat of the ancient hills.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And then, near noon, within a forest brake,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The ban-dogs roused a red gigantic stag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lashed to whose back with gnarly-knotted cords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And borne along like some pale parasite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man shrieked: tangle-bearded, and wild hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mane of forest-burs. The man himself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Emaciated and half-naked from<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stag's mad flight through headlong rocks and trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One bleeding bruise, with eyes like holes of fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For such the law then: when the peasant chased<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or slew the dun deer of his tyrant lords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If seized, as punishment the withes and spine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some strong stag, a gift to him of game,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough till death&mdash;death in the antlered herd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or slow starvation in the haggard hills.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then was the great Duke glad, and forthwith cried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To all his hunting train a rich reward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For him who slew the stag and saved the man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But death for him who slew both man and stag.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So plunged the hunt after the hurrying slot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shout and glimmer through the sounding woods,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like some mad torrent that the hills have loosed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With death for goal.&mdash;'T was late; and none had risked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shot as yet,&mdash;too desperate the risk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the poor life and a little gold,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When this young Kuno, with fierce eyes, wherein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hunt and impatience kindled reckless flame,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Cried, "Has the dew then made our powder wet?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or have we left our marksmanship at home?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here's for its heart! the Fiend direct my ball!"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fired into a covert deeply packed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An intertangled wall of matted night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein the eye might vainly strive and strive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pierce one fathom, earn one foot beyond.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, ha! the huge stag staggered from the brake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hit full i' the heart. And that wan wretch, unbound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was ta'en and cared for. Then his grace, the Duke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charmed with the eagle aim, called Kuno up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there to him and his forever gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forestkeepership.<br /></span>
<span class="i9">But envious tongues<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were soon at wag; and whispered went the tale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of how the shot was free, and how the balls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Used by young Kuno were free bullets&mdash;which<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To say is: Lead by magic moulded, in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The influence and directed, of the Fiend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some effect these tales, and had some force<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even with the Duke, who lent an ear so far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to ordain Kuno's descendants all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To proof of skill ere their succession to<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The father's office. Kurt himself hath shot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The silver ring out o' the popinjay's beak&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A good shot he, you see, who would succeed.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Of these enchanted bullets let me speak:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
<span class="i0">There may be such; our Earth has things as strange,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps, and stranger, that we doubt not of,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While we behold, not only 'neath the thatch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ignorance's hovel, but within<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pictured halls of Wisdom's palaces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How Superstition sits an honored guest.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">A cross-way let it be among the hills;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cross-way in a solitude of pines;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the lonely cross-way you must draw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A blood-red circle with a bloody sword;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And round the circle, runic characters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gaunt and satanic; here a skull, and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A scythe and cross-bones, and an hour-glass here;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the centre, fed with coffin-wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stol'n from the grave of one, a murderer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A smouldering fire. Eleven of the clock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first ball leaves the mold&mdash;the sullen lead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mixed with three bullets that have hit their mark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blood, the wounded Sacramental Host<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stolen, and hence unhallowed, oozed, when shot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixed to a riven pine. Ere twelve o'clock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With never a word until that hour sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must all the balls be cast; and these must be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In number three and sixty; three of which<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Fiend's dark agent, demon Sammael,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Claims for his master and stamps for his own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hit aside their mark, askew for harm.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The other sixty shall not miss their mark.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">No cry, no word, no whisper, even though<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vague, gesturing shapes, that loom like moonlit mists,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their faces human but with animal forms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise thick around and threaten to destroy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No cry, no word, no whisper should there come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weeping, a wandering shadow like the girl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You love, or loved, now lost to you, her eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hollow with tears; all palely beckoning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With beautiful arms, or censuring; her face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad with a desolate love; who, if you speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or waver from that circle&mdash;hideous change!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrinks to a wrinkled hag, whose harpy hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall tear you limb from limb with horrible mirth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor be deceived if some far midnight bell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strike that anticipated hour; nor leave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By one short inch the circle, for, unseen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though now they be, Hell's minions still are there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching with flaming eyes to seize your soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the hour of midnight sounds, be sure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have your bullets, neither more nor less;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if through fear one more or less you have,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your soul is forfeit to Hell's majesty.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then while the hour of midnight strikes, will come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A noise of galloping hoofs and outriders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shouting; six midnight steeds,&mdash;their nostrils, pits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of burning blood,&mdash;postilioned, roll a stage,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Black and with groaning wheels of spinning fire:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Room there!&mdash;ho! ho!&mdash;who bars the mountain-way?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On over him!"&mdash;But fear not, nor fare forth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'T is but the last trick of your bounden slave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ere the red moon rushes through the clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dives again, high the huge leaders leap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their fore-hoofs fire, and their eye-balls flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, spun a spiral spark into the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whistling the phantom flies and fades away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some say there comes no stage; that Hackelnburg,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wild-huntsman of the Harz, comes dark as storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rain and wind and demon dogs of Hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The terror of his hunting-horn, an owl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dim deer he hunts, rush on before;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forests crash, and whirlwinds are the leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the skies a-thunder, as he hurls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight on the circle, horse and hounds and stag.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at the last, plutonian-cloaked, there comes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a stallion gaunt and lurid black,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The minister of Satan, Sammael,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who greets you, and informs you, and assures.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Enough! these wives'-tales told, to what I've seen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Ammendorf I came; and Rudolf here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Kurt and his assembled men, I met.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The abundant year,&mdash;like some sweet wife,&mdash;a-smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At her brown baby, Autumn, in her arms,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Stood 'mid the garnered harvests of her fields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dreaming of days that pass like almoners<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scattering their alms in minted gold of flowers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of nights, that forest all the skies with stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherethrough the moon&mdash;bare-bosomed huntress&mdash;rides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One cloud before her like a flying fawn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I proposed the season's hunt; till eve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The test of Rudolf's skill postponed, at which<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seemed impatient. And 't was then I heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How he an execrable marksman was;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tales that told of near, incredible shots,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That missed their mark; or how his flint-lock oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flashed harmless powder, while the curious deer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood staring; as in pity of such aim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bidding him try his marksmanship again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Howbeit, he that day acquitted him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all this gossip; in that day's long hunt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Missing no shot, however rashly made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or distant through the intercepting trees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the piled, various game brought down of all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good marksmen of Kurt's train had not sufficed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubled, nay, trebled, there to match his heap.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And marvelling the hunters saw, nor knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How to excuse them. My indulgence giv'n,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some told me that but yesterday old Kurt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had made his daughter weep and Rudolf frown,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
<span class="i0">By vowing end to their betrothéd love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless that love developed better aim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the morrow's test; his ancestors'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High fame should not be tarnished. So he railed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bowed his gray head and sat moodily;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But looking up, forgave all when he saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tears in his daughter's eyes and Rudolf gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out in the night black with approaching storm.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Before this inn, yonder and here, they stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The holiday village come to view the trial:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair maidens and their comely mothers with<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sweethearts and their husbands. And I marked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kurt and his daughter here; his florid face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All jubilant at Rudolf's great success;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hers, radiant with happiness; for this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her <a name='TC_2'></a><ins title="Was 'marrige'">marriage</ins> eve&mdash;so had her father said&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should Rudolf come successful from the hunt.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">So pleased was I with what I'd seen him do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trial of skill superfluous seemed, and so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was on the bare brink of announcing, when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the western heaven's deepening red,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a white message dropped by rosy lips,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wild dove clove the luminous winds and there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon that limb, a peaceful moment sat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I, "Thy rifle, Rudolf! pierce its head!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried pointing, "and chief-forester art thou!"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why did he falter with a face as strange<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
<span class="i0">As a dark omen? did his soul foresee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was to be with tragic prescience?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What a bad dream it all seems now!&mdash;Again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see him aim. Again I hear the cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My dove! O Rudolf, do not kill my dove!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the crowd, like some sweet dove herself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fluttering whiteness, came our Ilsabe&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too late! the rifle cracked ... The unhurt dove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose, beating frightened wings&mdash;but Ilsabe!...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sight! the sight!... lay smitten; a red stain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sullying the pureness of her bridal bodice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showed where the ball had pierced her through the heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And Rudolf?&mdash;Ah, of him you still would know?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he beheld this thing that he had done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why he went mad&mdash;I say&mdash;but others not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An hour he raved of how her life had paid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the unholy bullets he had used,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how his soul was three times lost and damned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I say that he went mad and fled forthwith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the haunted Harz.&mdash;Some say, to die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prey of demons of the Dummburg ruin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, one of those less superstitious, say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He in the Bodé&mdash;from that blackened rock,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereon were found his hunting-cap and gun,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Devil's Dancing Place, did leap and die.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From the terrace here, where the hills indent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You can see the uttermost battlement<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the castle there; the Cliffords' home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the seasons go and the seasons come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never a footstep else doth fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save the prowling fox's; the ancient hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Echoes no voice save the owlet's call:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its turret chambers are homes for the bat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And its courts are tangled and wild to see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where in the cellar was once the rat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The viper and toad move stealthily.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long years have passed since the place was burned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he sailed to the wars in France and earned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The name that he bears of the bold and true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On his tomb. Long years, since my lord, Sir Hugh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lived; and I was his favorite page,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the thing then happened; and he of an age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When a man will love and be loved again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or hie to the wars or a monastery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or toil till he conquer his heart's sore pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or drink and forget it and finally bury.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I was his page. And often we fared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the Clare demesnes, in autumn, hawking;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the Baron had known, how they would have glared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Neath their bushy brows, those eyes of mocking!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That last of the Strongbows, Richard, I mean&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And growling some six of his henchmen lean<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To mount and after this Clifford and hang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his crop-eared page to the nearest oak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How he would have cursed us while he spoke!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Clare and Clifford had ever a fang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the other's side ... And I hear the clang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his rage in the hall when the hawker told&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he told!&mdash;how we met on the autumn wold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His daughter, sweet Clara of Clare, the day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hooded tiercel its brails did burst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trailing its jesses, came flying our way&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An untrained haggard the falconer cursed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While he tried to secure:&mdash;as the eyas flew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slant, low and heavily over us, Hugh,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who saw it coming, and had just then cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His peregrine hawk at a heron quarry,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his saddle rising, so, as it passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the jesses caught, and to her did carry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where she stood near the wood. Her face flushed rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the glad of the meeting. No two foes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her eyes and my Lord's, I swear, who saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas love from the start. And I heard him speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some words; then he knelt; and the sombre shaw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the rust of the autumn waste and bleak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew spring with her smile, as the hawk she took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On her lily wrist, where it pruned and shook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its ragged wings. Then I saw him seize<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hand, that she reached to him, long and white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she smilingly bade him rise from his knees&mdash;<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When he kissed its fingers, her eyes grew bright.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But her cheeks grew pallid when, lashing through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The woodland there, with a face a-flare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the sting of the wind, and his gipsy hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flying, the falconer came, and two<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or three of the people of Castle Clare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the leaves of the autumn made a frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the picture there in the morning's flame.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What was said in that moment, I do not know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That moment of meeting, between those lovers;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And soft as a leaf that swings and hovers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A twinkling gold, when the leaves are yellow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her face with the joy was still aglow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When down through the wood that burly fellow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came with his frown, and made a pause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the pulse of their words. My lord, Sir Hugh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood with the soil on his knee. No cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had he, but his hanger he partly drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then clapped it sharp in its sheath again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bowed to my Lady, and strode away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mounting his horse, with a swinging rein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rode with a song in his heart all day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He loved and was loved, I knew; for, look!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All other sports for the chase he forsook.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strange that he never went to hawk,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Or hunt, but Clara would meet him there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the Strongbow forest! I know the rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With its fern-filled moss, by the bramble lair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were oft and again he met&mdash;by chance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I say?&mdash;the daughter of Clare; as fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of face as a queen in an old romance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who waits with her sweet face pale; her hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night-deep; and eyes dove-gray with dreams;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the fountain-side where the statue gleams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the moonbeam lolls in the lily white,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the knightly lover who comes at night.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Heigho! they ceased, those meetings; I wot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betrayed to the Baron by some of his crew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of menials who followed and saw and knew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she loved too well to have once forgot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The time and the place of their trysting true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why and when?" would ask Sir Hugh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the labored letters he used to lock&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lovers' post&mdash;in a coigne of that rock.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She used to answer, but now did not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nearing Yule, love got them again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A twilight tryst&mdash;through frowardness sure!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They met. And that day was gray with rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or snow: and the wind did ever endure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A long bleak moaning thorough the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That chapped i' the cheek and smarted the blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a brook in the forest went throb and throb,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And over it all was the wild-beast sob<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the rushing boughs like a thing pursued.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then it was that he learned how she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(God's blood! how it makes my old limbs quiver<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think what a miserable tyrant he&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Baron Richard&mdash;aye and ever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his daughter was!) forsooth! must wed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With an eastern earl, a Lovell: to whom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Would God o' his mercy had struck him dead!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clara of Clare when only a child,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a face like a flower, that blooms in the wild<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the hills, and a soul like its soft perfume,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was given; to seal, or strengthen, some ties<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of power and wealth&mdash;say bartered, then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the merest chattel. With tearful eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trembling lips she spoke; and when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her lover, the Clifford, had learned and heard,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'd have had her flee with him then, 'sdeath!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spite of them all! Let her speak the word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They would fly together; the Baron's men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might follow, and if ... and he touched his sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It should answer! But she, while she seemed to stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a hand on her bosom, her heart's quick breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Replied to his heat, "They would take and slay<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The words that she spoke, how well I remember!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As well as the mood o' that day of December,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bullied and blustered and seemed in league,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a spiteful shrew, with the wind and snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drown the words of their sweet intrigue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the boom of the boughs tossed to and fro.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whither, but why, you well can guess.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For often he whispered a certain name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The talisman of his happiness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That warmed his blood like a yule-log's flame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While we waited there, till its owner came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw how the castle's baronial girth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a giant's, loosed for reveling more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone; and we heard the wassail and mirth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the mistletoe hung in the hearth's red roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the holly brightened the weaponed wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ancient oak in the banqueting hall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the spits, I trow, by the scullions turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the snoring logs, rich steamed and burned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the whole wild-boar and the deer were roasted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the half of an ox and the roe-buck haunches;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While tuns of ale, that the cellars boasted,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And casks of sack, were broached for paunches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of vassals who reveled in stable and hall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The song of the minstrel; the yeomen's quarrel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the dice and the drink; and the huntsman's bawl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the baying kennels, its hounds a-snarl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the bones of the banquet; now loud, now low,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Shivering there in the hiss of the gale:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With flowers of dust; and a miniver<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For the secret spring of that panel, hoping<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fearing as nearer and nearer drew<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The tell-tale taper; and, seeing this chest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would hide her a minute in it, mayhap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the hurry had passed; but the death-lock, pressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the lid's great weight, closed fast with a snap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere her heart was aware of the fiendish trap.<br /></span>

<p>During the siege of Bryan's Station, Kentucky, August 16, 1782, Nicholas
Tomlinson and Thomas Bell, two inhabitants of the Fort, undertook to
ride through the besieging Indian and Tory lines to Lexington, Ky., for
aid. It happened also during this siege that the pioneer women of the
Fort, when the water supply was exhausted, heroically carried water from
a spring, at a considerable distance outside the palisades of the
Station, to its inmates, under the very guns of the enemy.</p>

<h3>TO J. FOX, JR.</h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You remember how the mist,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When we climbed to Devil's Den,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Pearly in the mountain glen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And above us, amethyst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throbbed or circled? then away,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Through the wildwoods opposite,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Torn and scattered, morning-lit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vanished into dewy gray?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vague as in romance we saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From the fog, one riven trunk,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Talon-like with branches shrunk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrust a monster dragon claw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we climbed for hours through<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The dawn-dripping Jellicoes,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To a wooded rock that shows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Undulating leagues of blue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Summits; mountain-chains that lie<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Dark with forests; bar on bar,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ranging their irregular<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Purple peaks beneath a sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft as slumber. Range on range<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Billow their enormous spines,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where the rocks and priestly pines<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sit eternal, without change.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
<span class="i0">We were sons of Nature then:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She had taken us to her,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Signalized by brier and burr,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something more to her than men:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pupils of her lofty moods,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From her bloom-anointed looks,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Wisdom of no man-made books<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Learned we in those solitudes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How the seed supplied the flower;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How the sapling held the oak;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How within the vine awoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wild impulse still to tower;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How in fantasy or mirth,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Springing from her footsteps there,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Curious fungi everywhere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bulged, exuded from the earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coral vegetable things,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That the underworld exhaled,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bulbous, crystal-ribbed and scaled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many colored and in rings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the Indian-Pipe that grew<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Pink and white in loamy cracks,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Flowers of a natural wax,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had turned her fancy to.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On that laureled precipice,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where the chestnuts dropped their burrs,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sweet with balsam of the firs,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
<span class="i0">First we felt her mother kiss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full of heaven and the wind;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">While the forests, wood on wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Murmured like a multitude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Giving praise where none hath sinned.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freedom met us there; we saw<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Freedom giving audience;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In her face the eloquence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lightning-like, of love and law:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round her, with majestic hips,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lay the giant mountains; there<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Near her, cataracts tossed their hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God and thunder on their lips.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft an eagle, or a hawk,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or a scavenger, we knew<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Winged through altitudes of blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By its shadow on the rock.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or a cloud of templed white<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Moved, a lazy berg of pearl,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Through the sky's pacific swirl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shot with cool cerulean light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So we dreamed an hour upon<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That warm rock the lichens mossed,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">While around us foliage tossed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coins, gold-minted of the sun:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then arose; and a ravine,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
<span class="i1">Which a torrent once had worn,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Made our roadway to the corn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the valley, deep and green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the farm house with its bees,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where old-fashioned flowers spun<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Gay rag-carpets in the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hid among the apple trees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here we watched the twilight fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">O'er Wolf-Mountain sunset made<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A huge rhododendron rayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round the sun's cloud-centered ball.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then through scents of herb and soil,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To the mining-camp we turned,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In the twinkling dusk discerned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With its white-washed homes of toil.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, those nights!&mdash;We wandered forth<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On some haunted mountain path,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When the moon was late, and rathe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The large stars, sowed south and north,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Splashed with gold the purple skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the milky zodiac,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Rolled athwart the belted black,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed a path to Paradise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we walked or lingered till,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In the valley-land beneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like the vapor of a breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathed in frost, arose the still<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Architecture of the mist:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the moon-dawn's necromance<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Touched the mist and made it glance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a town of amethyst.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then around us, sharp and brusque,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Night's shrill insects strident strung<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Instruments that buzzed and sung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pixy music of the dusk.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we seemed to hear soft sighs,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And hushed steps of ghostly things,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fluttered feet or rustled wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moved before us. Fire-flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleaming in the tangled glade,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Seemed the eyes of warriors<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Stealing under watching stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To some midnight ambuscade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the Indian village there,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Wigwamed with the mist, that slept<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By the woodland side, whence crept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shadowy Shawnees of the air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the moon rose, like a cup<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lay the valley, brimmed with wine<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of mesmeric shade and shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the moon's pale face held up.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she rose from out the mines<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of the eastern darkness, night<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Met her, clad in dewy light<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
<span class="i0">'Mid Pine Mountain's sachem pines.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As from clouds in pearly parts<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Her serene circumference grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Home we turned. And all night through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dreamed the dreams of happy hearts.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Doctrines, till mine seemed some Socratic seat<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
<span class="i0">High on the summit of Philosophy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around the wave of one Religion taught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her first rude children. From the stars that burned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the mountained other, Science learned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first vague lessons of the work she wrought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Daughters of God, in whom we still behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Age of Iron and the Age of Gold.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It is as if imperial trumpets broke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again the silence on War's iron height;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Cæsar's armored legions marched to fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Rome, blood-red upon her mountain-yoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blazed like an awful sunset. At a stroke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again I see the living torches light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The horrible revels, and the bloated, white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bayed brow of Nero smiling through the smoke:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here and there a little band of slaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among dark ruins; and the form of Paul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bearded and gaunt, expounding still the Word:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And towards the North the tottering architraves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of empire; and, wild-waving over all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flaming figure of a Gothic sword.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Song hath a catalogue of lovely things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy kind hath oft defiled,&mdash;whose spite misleads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world too often!&mdash;where the poet reads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in a fable, of old envyings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crows, such as thou, which hush the bird that sings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or kill it with their cawings; thorns and weeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as thyself, 'midst which the wind sows seeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of flow'rs, these crush before one blossom swings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here and there the wisdom of a School<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unknown to these hath often written down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Fame" in white ink the future hath turned brown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When every beauty, heaped with ridicule,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their ignoble prose, proved their renown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making each famous&mdash;as an ass or fool.<br /></span>
